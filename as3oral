1. Question: What is the purpose of the accept function in the Student class?Answer: The accept function is used to gather information about a student, including their roll number, name, and address. It uses cin and getline to read and store this information in the respective private member variables of the Student class.2. Question: How does the acceptFeedback function work?Answer: The acceptFeedback function collects feedback from the student in the form of "Yes/No" answers for five predefined questions. It stores these responses in the feedback vector. Each response is stored as a string in the vector.3. Question: What sorting algorithm is used in the selectionSort function? Briefly explain how it works.Answer: The selectionSort function implements the Selection Sort algorithm. It works by iterating through the list of students and selecting the smallest roll number from the unsorted part of the list and swapping it with the first element of the unsorted part. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted by roll number.4. Question: How does the linearSearch function determine if a student attended the session?Answer: The linearSearch function iterates through the list of students and checks if any studentâ€™s roll number matches the target roll number input by the user. If a match is found, it prints "Student Attended the Session"; otherwise, it prints "Student Not Attended the Session."5. Question: Explain the process of binary search in the binarySearch function.Answer: The binarySearch function first sorts the list of students using selectionSort. Then, it performs a binary search by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the target roll number is less than the middle element, the search continues on the lower half; if it's greater, the search continues on the upper half. If a match is found, it indicates that the student attended the session.6. Question: What is the purpose of the analyzeFeedback function?Answer: The analyzeFeedback function tallies the number of "Yes" and "No" responses for each of the five feedback questions across all students. It then prints out the results, showing how many students responded "Yes" or "No" to each question.7. Question: How does the code ensure that the student's name and address are read correctly, even if they contain spaces?Answer: The code uses getline(cin, name) and getline(cin, address) to read the entire line of input, allowing spaces to be included in the student's name and address. This avoids issues with cin that would stop reading at the first space.8. Question: What would happen if you tried to search for a roll number that doesn't exist in the list? How is this handled in both the linear and binary search functions?Answer: If the roll number does not exist in the list, both the linearSearch and binarySearch functions will not find a match and will set the flag to 0. The functions will then print "Student Not Attended the Session."9. Question: Why is the feedback.clear() method called at the beginning of the acceptFeedback function?Answer: The feedback.clear() method is called to ensure that any previous feedback for the student is removed before accepting new feedback. This prevents old feedback from being mixed with the new responses.10. Question: How does the program handle the choice of operations in the main function?Answer: The main function uses a while loop and a switch statement to handle different user choices. It continuously prompts the user to enter a choice, and depending on the input, it calls the corresponding function to perform the desired operation (like adding a student, displaying information, performing a search, or analyzing feedback). The loop exits when the user chooses to analyze feedback and exit.
